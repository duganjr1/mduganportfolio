                    <p>3D Modeling is a way to create physical objects but in a virtual space, 
                        but I don't see it just as creating something. I see it as art. Below this is an image of an modern kitchen interior
                        that I made in a cooperative effort with a friend who majors in engineering and architecture.</p>

                    <p>Animating is how things move in games and other media faucets like animations, movies, and videos. Personally I think animation
                        absolutely enhances how a model can be percieved, especially when you're just looking for that right angle. Below this block will be
                        an animation of a U.F.O. flying through space.

                    <p>Photography is a hard one, it can be considered many things like a profession, a hobby, a lifestyle, art, or simply an image. However,
                        I believe it's encapsulates the beauty of something that we may never see again or can't replicate. Even if we can, enstilling it inside
                        a picture is something that everyone and anyone can apprectiate atleast once.

                    <p>This is a 3D interior design project I did. I believe it's one of the best thing's I've made so far regarding Modeling
                        and I like to put myself to realistic expectations when it comes to modeling because trying for perfection means it can't 
                        be improved and aiming for laziness means nothing will look right. This was one of those times I was able to hit the center 
                        and impress myself.

                    <p>This one is a U.F.O project, it's called Asteroid. The reason is because an asteriod gets blown up but I don't think that's 
                        the main selling point of this video. It took me several days to work on this and I tried to make it as indepth as I could by 
                        adding details like an aliens hand pulling down a lever, adding an interior which was a first at the time, adding several exterior 
                        details which wasn't a first but still proved to be a challenge and lastly, I think it encompasses exactly what animation can be even 
                        if it's capable of improvement. To me it shows me some of the exact angles you'd look for.

                    <p>For this I believe the other photographs are better, but this one has a bit of story and history behind it. This is near an area I live 
                        by and I spent a bit a time walking near these flowers always watching them bloom, mature, wilt, and fade as time came and went but one 
                        thing always stayed the same, the flowers did. Now whether or not it was due to someone being a caretaker for them is up to speculation 
                        but I always enjoyed seeing them, so I captured the image of it.

                        The overall process is incredibly varied dependant on what is being done and what deadlines are set. If no deadline is set
                    then it gives me time to add details, edit, review, and then finalize. I use Maya, Blender, Unity, Unreal, Graphics Gale, DaVinci Resolve,
                    and Mudbox. I also use OBS Studio and several IDE'S from NetBeans to Visual Studio Code. Finally, the process can be indepth, I first sketch
                    an idea on what i'm making, prepare assets, and begin creating what I would be working on. If additional details, reference imagery, or even 
                    other assets were involved it could take less time as I'd have a foundation to work up from.</p>

                        My name is Michael Dugan Jr, I'm an aspiring 3D modeller, animator, and programmer. In my free time I like to do 
                        photography, gardening, bowling, reading, and overall talking with friends. Personally, I enjoy to see when things 
                        hit their peak, the final step of things, it could be completing a really difficult task or accomplishing a nearly
                        overwhelming goal. I use this joy of creation and turn it into motivation so when I'm asked to do something or 
                        instead I want something done then I apply myself and work diligently.
